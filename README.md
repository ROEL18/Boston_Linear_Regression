# Boston Housing Price Prediction

This project predicts house prices in Boston using a technique called linear regression. 

## What This Project Is About

We use data about houses in Boston to understand what factors affect house prices. Then, we create a model that can predict house prices based on these factors.

## The Data

The data includes information like:
- Crime rate
- Number of rooms
- Distance to job centers
- Property tax rate
- Pupil-teacher ratio
- And more

We use this data to predict the median value of houses.

## How to Use This Project

### 1. Get the Code

First, download the code:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/boston-linear-regression.git
cd boston-linear-regression
```

### 2. Install the Tools You Need

Next, install the necessary tools:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Project

Finally, run the project:
```bash
python main.py
```

This will process the data, train the model, and show you the results.

## Project Files

- `data/`: This folder can hold the dataset.
- `notebooks/`: Contains a Jupyter notebook for exploring the data.
- `src/`: Contains scripts for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
- `main.py`: Main script to run everything.
- `requirements.txt`: List of tools needed to run the project.

## Results

After running the project, you'll get:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): Tells you how close the predicted prices are to the actual prices.
- R-squared (RÂ²) score: Tells you how well the model explains the data.
